Refill Stripe subscriptions with credits, sell one-time booster credit packs, implement PAYG (pay-as-you-go) billing, award free credits as bonuses, manage prepaid credits / tokens. Your users will have wallet balances that they can spend on features, API calls, or other usage-based actions. Perfect for SaaS, AI apps, games, and API products with metered pricing / billing."
